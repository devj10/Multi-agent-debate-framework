This is a simulation of a multi-agent LLM debate framework that improves factuality and reasoning thorugh conflict resolution. In this model, there are two LLM agents, a Student and an Opponent, fine-tuned on distinct human-like behaviors. The Student agent acted as the proponent of the conflict and was hardwired to be helpful and cooperative. This agent was instructed on what conflict resolution strategy to use by the Teacher LLM agent, a trainer that utilizes conflict resolution strategy prompting techniques. The Opponent agent was hardwired to be adversarial and aggressive as a way of facilitating the argument. The Student and Opponent interacted under controlled conditions to evaluate the emergence of innovative conflict resolution strategies. After a certain number of interactions, the conversation was overall evaluated by our Judge LLM in terms of how well the two agents resolved the conflict. Based on the Judge's evaluation, we're able to analyze how effective the Teacher's strategy was in helping resolve the conflict.
